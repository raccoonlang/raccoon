# Raccoon Programming Language - Trademark Policy

## Overview

The Raccoon Programming Language name, logo, and associated visual elements (collectively, the "Raccoon Marks") represent the identity and goodwill of the Raccoon project. This document establishes guidelines governing the use of these assets to protect the project's intellectual property interests and maintain brand consistency.

## Current Status

While the Raccoon Marks are not presently registered as trademarks, they constitute valuable intellectual property assets of the Raccoon Programming Language project. These assets identify our programming language and its ecosystem to users and developers worldwide.

**Important Notice**: These guidelines, though not currently legally enforceable as registered trademarks, establish the foundation for our intellectual property protection strategy. As the project matures, we intend to formalize trademark protection for the Raccoon Marks, at which point these guidelines may become legally enforceable. We strongly encourage all parties to adhere to these guidelines from the outset.

## Authorized Uses Without Prior Permission

The following uses of the Raccoon Marks are generally authorized without explicit prior permission:

1. **Reference and Identification**: Referring to the Raccoon Programming Language in discussions, articles, tutorials, books, or other educational content, provided such references are accurate and not misleading.
2. **Compatibility Statements**: Describing tools, libraries, or applications that work with or support the Raccoon Programming Language, provided such statements are factually accurate.
3. **Technical Compatibility**: Using the Raccoon name to indicate technical compatibility with the Raccoon Programming Language in a factual manner.
4. **Educational and Informational Uses**: Accurately referencing the Raccoon Programming Language in educational and informational contexts.

## Community Project Guidelines

We value and encourage community contributions to the Raccoon ecosystem. Projects affiliated with Raccoon should adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Community Packages and Libraries**: You may use the Raccoon name to indicate that your package or library is designed for use with Raccoon (e.g., "raccoon-web-framework" or "Raccoon Web Framework").
2. **Unofficial Tools**: Tools that work with Raccoon should clearly indicate their unofficial status if not maintained by the core development team (e.g., "Unofficial Raccoon Package Manager").
3. **Community Documentation and Tutorials**: You may create documentation and tutorials for Raccoon, clearly indicating if they are not official resources.

## Media and Publication Uses

1. **Books and Publications**: You may use the Raccoon name in book titles such as "Programming in Raccoon" or "Raccoon Tutorial" without prior permission.
2. **Articles and Blog Posts**: You may reference Raccoon in articles and blog posts without prior permission.

3. **Commercial Endorsement**: Using the Raccoon name or logo for commercial purposes in a manner that might suggest official endorsement.
4. **Derivative Works**: Creating derivative programming languages based on Raccoon.

1. **Misrepresentation**: Using the Raccoon name or logo in a manner that is misleading or falsely suggests official endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation when none exists.
2. **Incompatible Products**: Using the Raccoon name for programming languages, tools, or products that are not compatible with or related to the official Raccoon Programming Language.
3. **Reputational Harm**: Using the Raccoon name or logo in a manner that could damage the reputation of the Raccoon Programming Language project.

## Policy Updates

As the Raccoon Programming Language project evolves, we may update this trademark policy to reflect changes in our intellectual property protection strategy. We reserve the right to modify these guidelines at any time at our sole discretion. Material changes will be communicated through appropriate project channels.

Our objective is to foster a vibrant ecosystem around Raccoon while safeguarding the integrity and distinctiveness of the project's identity.
