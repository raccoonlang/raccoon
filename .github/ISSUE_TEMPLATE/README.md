## Tips for Effective Issue Reporting

1. **Search first** - Check if a similar issue already exists before creating a new one
2. **One issue per report** - Create separate issues for separate problems
3. **Be specific** - Provide specific details rather than general statements
4. **Minimal examples** - When providing code samples, reduce them to the minimum needed to demonstrate the issue
5. **Follow up** - Be prepared to provide additional information if requested
